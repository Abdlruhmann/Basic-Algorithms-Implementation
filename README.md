# Basic Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of basic algorithms in **C**, including sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithmic techniques. The goal is to provide a simple, understandable approach to implementing these algorithms, which can be useful for educational purposes and foundational learning in computer science.

## Algorithms Included

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array and merges the sorted subarrays.
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - **Binary Search**: A fast searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

- **Utility Functions**:
  - **Student Management System**: A small program that demonstrates the use of algorithms by managing student data, including filling details, sorting students, and searching for a student by ID.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Fill, display, and manage student data (ID, name, grade).
- **Merge Sort**: Sort students by ID using the merge sort algorithm.
- **Bubble Sort**: Sort students by ID using the bubble sort algorithm.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently search for a student by their ID.
- **Interactive Menu**: A simple menu-driven interface to select various operations like sorting and searching.

## Requirements

To run the program, you'll need:

- A **C compiler** (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming
